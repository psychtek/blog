<p>Processing an image database for use in a experiment to induce an emotional state in particpants.</p>
<div id="research-protocol" class="section level3">
<h3>Research Protocol</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)
library(plotly)
library(gridExtra)
library(inspectdf)
library(DT)</code></pre>
<p>The following was the code used to prepare images from the IAPS database for a experiment on pattern separation. The participants were seated in front of a PC and went through three tasks: Encoding, retreival and validation. We were provided with a folder of approved images and a text file with unapproved images.</p>
</div>
<div id="raw-text-to-selected-iaps-images" class="section level3">
<h3>Raw text to selected IAPS images</h3>
<p>A raw text file was provided with the IAPS database image details I then used a script to then compare the images in the memory task folder and made a raw dataframe with all the IAPS data. There are 200 images overall. Old, new and fake conditions were added based on coding from the images folder.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>iaps_dataframe_images &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/iaps_raw.csv&quot;) #List of all IAPS images
RP_images &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/new_old_images.csv&quot;) #list of images used in our research protocol
RP_images &lt;- as.matrix(RP_images) # convert to matrix


ENC_orig_RET_New &lt;- na.omit(str_match(RP_images, &quot;^[[:digit:]]+\\.*[[:digit:]]*$&quot;)) # _ENC_ORIGINAL_50 whats left over RET_UNSEEN_NEW
RET_PS_a &lt;- na.omit(str_match(RP_images, &quot;[[:digit:]]{4}a$&quot;)) # _RET_PS_a 50
ENC_ORIGINAL_b &lt;- na.omit(str_match(RP_images, &quot;[[:digit:]]{4}b$&quot;)) # _ENC_ORIGINAL_b 50
# RET_UNSEEN_NEW

# match IAPS numbers to ones we have selected for RP
group39_df &lt;- filter(iaps_dataframe_images, nr %in% str_extract(all_images_list, &quot;\\d{4}&quot;))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="negative-and-neutral-images" class="section level3">
<h3>Negative and Neutral Images</h3>
<p>The following functions compare the iaps_dataframe_images using the nr column numbers to the
vectors made previously above.</p>
<p>Highly negative and neutral images were coded by looking at the means and then
coding highly aroused <em>negative</em> images that have a mean greater than 4.5. All neutral low
<em>neutral images</em> were coded with valence means less than 4.0.</p>
<p>A dataframe of all the images being used in the experiment are then stored into the group39_df.
ENC_RET_ORIG_UNSEEN needs to be seperated with 50 images to be used in the retrieval task.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>group39_df_mutate &lt;- group39_df %&gt;% #Create Negative and Neutral cases
  select_all() %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    Emotion = case_when(
      aromn &gt; 4.5  ~ &quot;Negative&quot;, 
      valmn &gt; 4.0 ~ &quot;Neutral&quot;))

group39_df &lt;- group39_df_mutate

# Core master list of all images 

core_images_df &lt;- filter(group39_df, Condition != &quot;RET_PS_a&quot;)
# </code></pre>
<p>We have three tasks: Encoding, Retreival and Validation. The images that were marked a or b are the ones
that have been photoshopped to look like their counterparts. However, we need to take the 100 images that are
not marked and split them so that half are used in the encoding and the ones not used, introduced into the
retrieval task and marked as new/unseen.</p>
<p>The group39_df also has all the negative and neutral emotion conditions attached to eaech image so we can now filter accordingly.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>encoding_list &lt;- filter(group39_df, Condition == &quot;ENC_RET_ORIG_UNSEEN&quot;) %&gt;% arrange(Emotion) 
# filter the raw list by first 100

ENC_ONLY_ORIG$Condition[ENC_ONLY_ORIG$Condition == &quot;ENC_RET_ORIG_UNSEEN&quot;] &lt;- &quot;ENC_ONLY&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We now have vectors with all the information needed. Below are the dataframes for eaech task and then joined together
to create the main spreadsheet for use in the lab.</p>
